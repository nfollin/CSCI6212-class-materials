# Greedy Algorithm

```
    Greedy( S )
      P = []                   // processed
      while (solutionFound(P)) // usually is S empty
        i = selection(S)       // usually best choice
        P.add(i)
        S.remove(i)
```

From Wikipedia:

> "We can make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the subproblems that arise later. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices made so far but not on future choices or all the solutions to the subproblem. It iteratively makes one greedy choice after another, reducing each given problem into a smaller one. In other words, a greedy algorithm never reconsiders its choices."
