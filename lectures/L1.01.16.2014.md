# Algorithm Analysis

## Min-max problem

Given *n* numbers, find the maximum and the minimum

### Algorithm 1

### Algorithm 2

## Analysis

### Time

Number of operations as a function of input size

Ignore all the factors are dependent on machine and programming language and focus on the frequence of executing statements.

#### Asymtotic Notation

##### Big O

##### Big Ω

##### Big ϴ

##### Examples and Characteristics

### Space

Amount of memory needed by the algorithm

# Data Structure

## Stacks

### Structure
Collection of entities with Last-in-First-out (LIFO) data structure.

### Operations
- Push
- Pop
- Top

## Queue

### Structure
Collection of entities with First-in-First-out (FIFO) data structure.

### Operations

- Enqueue
- Deque

## Graphs

### Structure

A graph, G, is defined by finite set of vertices (or nodes), V, and edges E. Written as:

    G = (V, E)

Where

    E ⊆ V ⨯ V

An edge is written as (x,y) where x and y is the vertex.

### Terminology

- G is a **directed** graph if (x,y) != (y,x)
- G is an **undirected** graph if (x,y) == (y,x)
- If E = (x,y) then x is **adjacent to** y and y is **adjacent from** x 
- If G is undirected graph then we can also say x is the **neighbor** of y
- **indegree**(x) is the number of vertices adjacent to x
- **outdegree**(x) is the number of vertices adjacent from x
- **degree**(x) is the number of neighbors of x
- **path**
- **length**
- **cycle**
- **connected** graph

## Implementation

* Adjacency matrix
* Array of linked lists


## Tree
A connected acyclic graph

### Rooted tree
A tree with a designated vertex called root.

- Parent
- Child

### Binary Tree
A rooted tree where every node in the tree has at most two children.

### Bianry Search Tree
A binary tree where 

1. every node has a key which has a value associated with it
2. for every node x, all the nodes in the left subtree of x have keys that are less than or equal to x and all the nodes in the right subtree of x have keys that are > x

### Operation

- Insert
- Delete
- Search


## Disjoint Set (Find/Union Algorithm)
