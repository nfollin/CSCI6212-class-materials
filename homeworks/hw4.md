# Homework 4

1. Consider *n* number of jobs, where each one takes exactly one minute to complete. At any time *T* = 1, 2, 3, ..., we can execute exactly one job. Each job *i* earns a profit of *p<sub>i* dollars if and only if it is executed no later than time *d<sub>i</sub>*, where {*d<sub>1</sub>*, *d<sub>2</sub>*, ... , *d<sub>n</sub>*} is given as input. The problem is to schedule the jobs to maximise the profit.<br/><br/>Consider the following greedy strategy: For all the jobs with deadline at 1 minute, schedule the job with the maximum profit. Next, for all the jobs with deadline at 2 minutes or less, pick the job with maximum profit from the remaining unscheduled jobs. And so on. For example, consider *n* = 4, profits *P* = {50, 10, 15, 300} and deadline D = {2, 1, 2, 1}. The greedy strategy will yield the following solution: job 4 and job 1 to be schedule for a total of profit of 80 dollars.<br/><br/>Give a counter example to prove that this greedy strategy does not always work.<br/><br/><br/>

2. Consider *n* number of files, F = {*F<sub>1</sub>*, *F<sub>2</sub>*, ... , *F<sub>n</sub>*}, where files have lengths, L = {*l<sub>1</sub>*, *l<sub>2</sub>*, ... , *l<sub>n</sub>*}, and access probabilities, P = {*p<sub>1</sub>*, *p<sub>2</sub>*, ... , *p<sub>n</sub>*}<br/><br/>Assume that these files are stored on a sequential access data storage (such as tape storage). To access *F<sub>i</sub>*, we have to load in all files that are placed before *F<sub>i</sub>*. For example, if we have 4 files of lengths {3, 1, 4, 2} and it was stored in sequence {*F<sub>1</sub>*, *F<sub>2</sub>*, *F<sub>3</sub>*, *F<sub>4</sub>*}, the access time for *F<sub>3</sub>* = *l<sub>1</sub>* + *l<sub>2</sub>* + *l<sub>3</sub>* = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8.<br/><br/>The problem is to order these files on the storage so as to minimize the expected access time. (Note, that this is very similar to the Scheduling Problem we learned in class). Given a storage sequence of {*F<sub>s<sub>1</sub></sub>*, *F<sub>s<sub>2</sub></sub>*, ... , *F<sub>s<sub>n</sub></sub>*}, the expected access time is <img src="https://raw2.github.com/GWU-KIM-CSCI/CSCI6212-class-materials/master/homeworks/hw4-1.png" align="center" />, where *p<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>* is the probability of *F<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>* being accessed and <img src="https://raw2.github.com/GWU-KIM-CSCI/CSCI6212-class-materials/master/homeworks/hw4-2.png" align="center" /> is the length of the first *i* files.<br/><br/>For each of the below greedy algorithms, either give a proof that the algorithm is correct, or a proof that the algorithm is incorrect.

   a. Order the files from shortest to longest on the storage. That is, *l<sub>i</sub>* < *l<sub>j</sub>* implies that *s<sub>i</sub>* < *s<sub>j</sub>*
   b. Order the files from most likely to be accessed to least likely to be accessed. That is, *p<sub>i</sub>* < *p<sub>j</sub>* implies that *s<sub>i</sub>* > *s<sub>j</sub>*
   c. Order the files from smallest ratio of length over access probability to largest. That is, <img src="https://raw2.github.com/GWU-KIM-CSCI/CSCI6212-class-materials/master/homeworks/hw4-3.png" align="center" /> implies that *s<sub>i</sub>* < *s<sub>j</sub>*<br/><br/><br/><br/>


3. Consider a currency system with coins worth *a<sub>1</sub>*, *a<sub>2</sub>*, ... , *a<sub>n</sub>* cents where *a<sub>1</sub>* = 1. Assume that you are given an unlimited numbers of coins of each type. The input to the problem is an integer *M* and the objective is to determine the number of coins of each type to make up *M* cents using the minimum number of coins. Consider a greedy algorithm that takes as many coins as possible from the highest denomination and repeat this with the next highest one, etc.<br /><br />Prove that this greedy algorithm correctly solve the coin change problem for the case when *a<sub>1</sub>* = 1, *a<sub>2</sub>* = 5, *a<sub>3</sub>* = 10, *a<sub>4</sub>* = 25, *a<sub>5</sub>* = 50.
