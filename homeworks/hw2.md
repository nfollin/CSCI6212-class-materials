1. Write a partition algorithm that uses O(1) memory space.

2. Use the master theorem to give the tight asymtotic bound for the following functions:

    a. T(n) = 2T(n/4) + 1
    b. T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n^(1/2)
    c. T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n
    d. T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n^2

3. Given set, S, of n numbers and a number x

    a. Design an O(n log n) time algorithm to determine whether there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly x.
    b. Suppose S is in sorted order, design an O(n) algorithm to solve 3a.

4. Given a list A of n numbers (can be identical), determine in O(n) time whether there exists a number
in A that appears more than n/2 times.
